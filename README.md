# Corwin Yip

** `Engineer (Software Developer/Engineering Physics)`**
I'm Corwin, will be completing the training at the end of April 2024. I am a software development trainee and recent graduate from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I studied Engineering Physics. During my studies, I undertook some programming courses and a final-year project focused on developing a smart home system. This project raised my interest in being a software developer and allowed me to enhance my programming skills using Python.
